# MegaDog Manifesto

## The Problem

Mobile gaming has become a cesspool of predatory mechanics:
- Fake "earn real money" promises
- Endless ad farming with no payoff
- Psychological manipulation designed by data scientists
- Dark patterns that exploit human weakness

The original MegaDog exemplifies this - promising cash payouts that never materialise, harvesting user attention for ad revenue, and explicitly admitting to "collecting psychological statistics."

## Our Response

MegaDog (Ethical Edition) proves that engaging games don't require exploitation.

### Core Principles

1. **No Fake Money Claims**
   - This is a game. You will not get rich.
   - Your rewards are digital dogs and beautiful fractals, not dollars.

2. **Transparent Mechanics**
   - All odds are public
   - All code is open source
   - All economics are visible on-chain

3. **Actual Ownership**
   - Your dogs are NFTs you truly own
   - Transferable, verifiable, permanent
   - Not "in-game items" that vanish when servers close

4. **Mathematical Beauty**
   - Each dog generates unique Mandelbrot fractals
   - Deterministic, reproducible, beautiful
   - Art from mathematics, not from manipulation

5. **Memory-Safe Architecture**
   - Pony: Actor-model server with no GC pauses
   - Vyper: Auditable smart contracts
   - Kotlin: Type-safe Android rendering
   - No Python in core paths

### The Technical Philosophy

We use logarithmic storage because it's efficient.
We use Mandelbrot fractals because they're beautiful.
We use blockchain because ownership should be real.
We use RSR standards because reliability matters.

### What We Don't Do

- Promise money
- Require ads for progression
- Sell user data
- Use dark patterns
- Gate content behind paywalls
- Employ variable reward schedules designed to addict

### What We Do

- Make a fun merge game
- Generate beautiful fractal art
- Prove that ethical games can exist
- Open source everything
- Explain our economics publicly

## The Math

Dogs are stored logarithmically:
```
Traditional: treats = 1,000,000,000 (uses uint256)
MegaDog: logTreats = ln(1,000,000,000) × 10^6 = 20,723,266 (uses int128)
```

This saves ~30% gas at scale and demonstrates that efficiency and ethics align.
